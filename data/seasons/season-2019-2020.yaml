    playwright: "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"
    director: "Douglas Nagel"
    description: "Marriage of Figaro (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) continues the plot of The Barber of Seville several years later, and recounts a single 'day of madness' in the palace of Count Almaviva near Seville, Spain. Rosina is now the Countess; Dr. Bartolo is seeking revenge against Figaro for thwarting his plans to marry Rosina himself; and Count Almaviva has degenerated from the romantic youth as the Barber into a scheming, bullying, skirt-chasing man. Having gratefully given Figaro a job as head of his servant-staff, the Count is now persistently trying to exercise his right to bed a servant girl on her wedding night with Figaro's bride-to-be, Susanna, who is the Countess's maid. The Count continually attempts to delay the civil part of the wedding of his two servants. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess conspire to embarrass the Count and expose his scheming. Will the love between the Count and Countess be restored?"

  - title: "An Evening With Sherlock Holmes"
    playwright: "Jules Tasca"
    director: "Mary Ann Connors"
    description: "An Evening with Sherlock Holmes is, indeed, unique. Three one-act plays showcase the skills of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, aided by housekeeper Mrs. Hudson and the Baker Street Irregulars. A collection of memorable characters, both good and evil, enhance the action. Reminiscent of a 19th century London pub, this production offers a variety of performers sharing their talents. Much like a revue, there will be short performances before the “Evening” gets under way, as well as a bit of fun and music between each individual “case” that is presented. The game’s afoot with mayhem, mystery, music and merriment."
