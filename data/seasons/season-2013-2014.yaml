August: Osage County is directed by NOVA’s new Interim Managing Producer, Craig Huisenga and features local actors Guy Vieg and Dina Brophy as patriarch Beverly Weston and his oldest daughter, Barbara. Ruth Nyback, a Red Lodge resident plays Violet Weston, the matriarch of the extended Weston clan.
