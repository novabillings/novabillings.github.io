    description: "It's a rare thing — coming up with an original Christmas show, let alone two. Steve Zediker has scripted his second holiday show with the help of pianist Teri Hammerquist. Zediker, a well-known Billings composer, producer and vocalist, has brought his band, Slainte, into the show, positioning them right up front on stage to showcase their authentic sound. They sing and play Celtic instruments including an autoharp, a concertina accordion and a bodrahn, which is an Irish drum. The band usually jams Friday night at Pug Mahon's, so you could say they've been rehearsing this show for a decade or more."
