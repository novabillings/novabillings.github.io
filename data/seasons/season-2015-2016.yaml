    director: "Douglas Nagel"
    description: "Set in the early 1950s, The Old Maid and the Thief tells the tale of the persuasive powers of women. The spinster, Miss Todd, takes in a strange man. Laetitia, her maid, becomes enamored of him. Together the two steal everything from Miss Todd, including her car, while Miss Pinkerton, a spinster friend of Miss Todd’s, is hot on their trail. (55 minutes) Florence, Italy, 1299: a hilarious sitcom? Yes, indeed. Gianni Schicchi (say Johnny SKEE-kee) is exactly that. Like vultures, a conniving family tries to redirect their rich relative’s will from a monastery to their own benefit through disguise, impersonation, and bribery, only to be out-foxed in the end. Laughs abound and young love triumphs in this one-act production which includes one of opera’s most beloved arias."
